<h2>

<h2>

    providers that collect and share information that may personally identify you.
</h2>
<h2><br/>
    One of these providers is <a class="text-blue-500"

        AdMob</a> and it
    collects information such as IP addresses, Approximate location, App interactions, Diagnostic information and Device
    and Account identifiers.<br/>
    This information is collected for purposes such as Advertising and marketing, Analytics, Fraud prevention,
    security and compliance.</h2>
<h2><br/>Another third party service provider through which the app collects information is

    collected
    goes from analytics and diagnostics to how many times the app has crashed,
    stack traces and other information directly related to a crash.</h2>
<h2><br/>
